; Suppose you have a phone number, such as 223-5766, and you'd like to figure out
; a clever way to spell it in letters for your friends to remember. Each digit corresponds
; to three possible letters. For example, the digit 2 corresponds to the letters A, B, and
; C. Write a procedure that takes a number as argument and returns a sentence of all the
; possible spellings:
;
; > (phone-spell 2235766)
; (AADJPMM AADJPMN . . . CCFLSOO)

; (We're not showing you all 2187 words in this sentence.) You may assume there are no
; zeros or ones in the number, since those don't have letters.
;
; Hint: This problem has a lot in common with the subsets example.

; Andy note: My solution is incomplete. It returns way too much at the moment.
